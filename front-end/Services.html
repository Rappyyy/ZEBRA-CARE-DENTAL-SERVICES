    <h1>Tooth Implants</h1>
        <p>In instances when a tooth cannot be saved and dental prosthesis is not ideal, a dental implant may be required.
             Dental implants involve the use of a tooth substitute – often times made of titanium – to replace the missing tooth and is placed within the bone. Over time, the dental implant will fuse with the bone via osseous integration and act just like a normal tooth. Dental 
            implants not only address esthetic concerns but it can restore a tooth’s functionality as well.</p>
